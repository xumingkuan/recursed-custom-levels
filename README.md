# Recursed Custom Levels
Custom levels I made for the game [*Recursed*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/497780/Recursed/).

To install and play:

1. Make sure that you have installed the DLC [*The Ice Palace*](https://recursed-ice-palace.github.io/).
2. Copy the (only) level file `Deeper Well.lua` to the folder `Recursed\custom\missions`. You should be able to find the folder `Recursed` in `(path\to\Steam)\steamapps\common`.
3. Start the game. The level is inside Start - Nexus - Custom.

Enjoy!

Note: the level is designed to be as hard as the levels in *The Ice Palace*, which is far more difficult than the main game.
